In order for the script to work, 
go into the 'glookoupload.py' file and change the username and password

username = 'yourusernamehere'
password = 'yourpasswordhere'

the script is also dependent on your file explorer window's top left corner being tucked into the 
top left corner of your screen. If it isn't in that location the autogui won't be able to find
the file in your file explorer window.
